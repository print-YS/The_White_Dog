    <h2>About the cutest white dog in the world</h2>
    <p>In a recent survey, a dog from <em>South Korea</em> was selected as the cutest white dog in the world. <br />
       There were many strong candidates, but its soft fur, clear eyes, and short legs captured the hearts of the judges. <br /><br /> 
       The dog's name is <strong>Hayan Song</strong> and it lives in Daejeon, South Korea. He is male dog turning two years old this year. <br />
       It belongs to the Coton de Tulear breed, and you can find detailed information about this breed in the link below.</p>

      <li>Sweet treat</li>
      <li>Tissue</li>
      <li>Slipper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Hayan's personality</h3>
    <p>Very timid and shy.  However, once he gets close, he wants to build a deep relationship with that person. <br />
       He doesn't get angry easily over trivial matters, but he warns fiercely if someone tries to invade its territory.</p>

    <h2>Habit</h2>
    <h3>Hayan's various habits</h3>
    <p>He has many habits. When he goes for a walk, he always has a habit of defecating. <br />
       He usually sleeps lying down in the corner of the room. When he finds something strange, he sometimes tilts his head to one side. <br />
       On the other hand, he has a troublesome habit, which is chewing on bathroom slippers. <br />
       The solution to this situation is as follows.</p>
    <h3>How to deal with it when the dog runs away with the slipper</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Approach the dog with its favorite snack in hand.</li>
      <li>Say "Spit it out."</li>
      <li>Wait until the dog spits out the slipper.</li>
      <li>When the dog spits out the slipper, give it the snack and take away the slipper.</li>
      <li>Place the slipper where the dog cannot reach it.</li>
    </ol>
